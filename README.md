## About

Scarlet Navigator is a free and open source project designed to make planning your courses less confusing and more intuitive. By looking at the bigger picture, you'll be more confident about your path towards graduation. Once a side-project, Scarlet Navigator is now managed, maintained, and developed by [Rutgers CSL](https://spec.cs.rutgers.edu/spaces/the-csl/).
